# Brainwrite ideation

---

## Roles:

Backend: Trevor, Hanlun, Aditya
Frontend: Aditya, Lakshanya, Matthew
DevOps: Matthew, Hanlun


## Overall idea
A combination-oriented game heavily inspired by Little Alchemy but WITH FOOD!
This project is specializing in baking goods
Maybe a shop where you get points for making food items, which you can use to buy new ingredients??


## Login Page
Using the POST Method to create a user
Updating the Users with PUT whenever we need to save what recipes they have created
Password hashing and storing in the backend for security purposes
Frontend
Drag the elements into the 
Tools: Oven, Stove, Knife, Rolling
Default Ingredients: Flour, Sugar, Eggs, 


## Backend
Store each user’s password and username
Store each user’s # of recipes, and which ingredients they have on their 
Store friendliest
Allow transfer of ingredients between users via messages
Store the recipe tree/the combinations you need for each food item


## Features:
Baking
Make a frontend block with slots to put ingredients + a bake button in order to “cook” the ingredients
Have a dictionary on the backend with a list of ingredients as the key, and an object(pts, name, and image) as the value
Whenever button clicked, get value from the dictionary that corresponds to the list of ingredients, then display the image, name, and add the points onto the user’s points
Use pts for each user (stored in user db) to buy ingredients that we can use 
Leaderboard: 
Use data from backend in order to create leaderboard for recipes unlocked/points or other things
Friendslist/Trading:
Be able to trade with other users, 
Create text box, in which user inputs the user they want to share the recipe with, then have a share button
Share button changes the recipe list for that user
On each user’s frontend, constantly make requests to the server, and once the length of the list of recipes changes, display a popup, “you've been shared the recipe for [recipe]!”
Crowdsourcing:
Give options to players to choose which new recipes will be added to the game


## Work distribution:
Aditya: Sandbox
List of ingredients from backend
Frontend to display icons for ingredients/recipes
Trevor: Trading
Send temporary link which updates the backend
Database of users to select from so that they can send
Reward collaboration between users
Add to point system on the database
Matthew: Leaderboard
Use userdb in order to grab all user’s data from backend
Use javascript in frontend to sort and display info in table format
Hanlun: Baking
Make dictionary with key as list of ingredients, then value of the object(pts,name,image)
Devops for baking backend, use dom in order to make little icons in order to display successful recipes
Lakshanya: Shop
Use points from backend, subtract points from backend when buying things
Make a frontend with icons for buying ingredients, with price/name


## DevOps
Login page to store user data and recipes
