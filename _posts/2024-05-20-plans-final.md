# Purpose
- We can use the algorithm to set up certain point benchmarks
For example, when a player hits 50 points, we can give them an alert that says they have earned a title. The next benchmark can be for when they have at least 75 points, then 100.

- We can set them up in increments
Set the beginning point value to 15, and each time they create a baked good that earns enough points to reach the next benchmark, they have a popup that appears.

15 points = Beginner
25 points = Rookie
45 points = Learner
65 points = Top Class
75 points = Master
100 points = Professional
