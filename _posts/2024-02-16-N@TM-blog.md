# My Team

Overall, a lot of people ended up being interested in our project, which is called "Let 'Em Cook!"
Here is a quick overview of the features:
- Sandbox - Drag and drop from inventory into 'oven' for combining
- Baking - Fetch the recipe from the backend to create a dessert, add points for each recipe found
- Shop - Ingredient organization with opportunity to buy with gained points
- Leaderboard - Orders the users with most points to least points
- Trading - Allows exchanging ingredients and recipes with friends

- Make instructions for game (purpose, how to play)

# Other CSP Projects I Saw

### Game Dashboard
- Included games like Mathopoly, Tic Tac Toe, Blackjack, and Crosswords
- I like that it gives users a choice of what to play
